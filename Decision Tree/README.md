# Decision Tree
This directory contains two classes used to implement the **Decision Tree** algorithm.

## decision_stump
This file includes three methods used to define the decision stumps applied in a decision tree.

#### DecisionStumpErrorRate
In this class, we want to split the data/examples by checking whether a feature is higher or lower than a threshold. We use the number of different corresponding predition and true value as error.
#### DecisionStumpInfoGain
In this class, we want to employ the information gain criterion to split the data/examples.
