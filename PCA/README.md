# PCA
This file includes two common algorithms in PCA.
## PCA
**Acknowledgement:** This class is copied from UBC CPSC 340 course material.

This is the classic PCA algorithm.

## AlternativePCA
This class implements an alternating minimization approach to minimizing the (L2) PCA objective (without enforcing orthogonality). This is a gradient-based approach to PCA.

## RobustPCA
It uses a smooth approximation to the absolute value to implement robust PCA.
